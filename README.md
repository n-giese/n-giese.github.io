		<p>This page will soon be the home of everything Mr. Giese. This is a work 
		in progress, and is being done as a hobby, so please be patient! :)</p>
		
		<p>There are a few pieces I would like to include on this site. <br>1. A 
		section about me. <br>2. A section with my schedule (along with an imbedded 
		calendar) <br>3. A section with data on the classes I offer. <br>4. A section
		with music I am currently interested in. <br>5. A section where people can 
		find my contact information.</p>
